- Designed and implemented a 5‑stage pipeline (Instruction Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory Access, and Write‑Back) for a 32‑bit MIPS‑based RISC processor in Verilog, optimizing instruction throughput and overall efficiency.

- Tested the processor design by executing basic programs, verifying its functional correctness and validating the effectiveness of the pipelined architecture.
