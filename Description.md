- Designed and implemented a 5‑stage pipeline (Instruction Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory Access, and Write‑Back) for a 32‑bit MIPS‑based RISC processor in Verilog, maximizing instruction and overall performance.

- Verified the processor design by running three test benches, ensuring its functional accuracy and confirming the efficacy of the pipelined architecture.
